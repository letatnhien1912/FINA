### **Features and Functionalities**
FINA has the following main functions:
1. Record and store transaction notes.

3. Report and analyze expenses and income.

FINA is built and used on the Google Sheets platform (recommended for computers) for easy access and use anytime, anywhere with internet access. Additionally, the tool will be saved in your personal Google Drive, so even the tool developer will not be able to access your information.

    * **Transfers**: Document transfers between different wallets/accounts (e.g., cash withdrawals, bank to savings transfers).

With these features, FINA empowers users to take control of their personal finances, providing tools for effective management and analysis.

### **Future Enhancements**
There are several opportunities for improvement to increase its accessibility and functionality:

#### **1. Mobile App Development**
* **Accessibility**: Currently, FINA is primarily designed for computer users, limiting its accessibility. Developing a mobile app version would allow users to manage their finances on the go, enhancing convenience and usability.
* **Development Approaches**: The mobile app could be developed using various programming languages and frameworks, including:
    * **Python**: Leveraging frameworks like Kivy or BeeWare to create a cross-platform mobile application.
    * **Java**: Utilizing Android Studio to build a native Android app that offers seamless integration with Google Sheets.
    * **Google Apps Script**: Exploring the possibility of extending the existing Google Sheets functionalities into a mobile-friendly format while maintaining the tool's operational mechanisms and design.

#### **2. Enhanced User Interface and Experience**
* **Responsive Design**: Ensure the app interface is optimized for different screen sizes and orientations, providing a consistent and intuitive user experience across devices.
* **User Feedback Integration**: Implement a feedback mechanism to gather user insights and continuously improve the app based on user preferences and needs.

#### **3. Advanced Features**
* **Real-Time Data Syncing**: Enable real-time syncing between the mobile app and Google Sheets to ensure users have the latest financial information at their fingertips.
* **Push Notifications**: Introduce reminders and alerts for upcoming bills, budget limits, and financial goals to help users stay on track with their finances.

By implementing these future enhancements, FINA can evolve into a more versatile and user-friendly personal finance management solution, catering to a wider audience and adapting to the changing needs of users.

### **Conclusion**
In conclusion, FINA has successfully emerged as an effective personal finance management tool tailored for office workers aiming to manage their finances systematically and strategically. With its comprehensive features, including transaction recording, asset reporting, and detailed income and expense analysis, FINA empowers users to take control of their financial health.
